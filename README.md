# that-volcano

the local. the friend circle, the acquaintance circle, the strangers circle. you can never tell anymore. the bot, the human, and the self. what a blur.

data privacy seems not a matter of 'what data' but a matter of 'if there is data privacy at all'.

also people are lonely, feeling detached in life, falsely or mistakenly connected online. you can't rly tell what is real and what is fake anymore.

what an era.

a human life shall be re-examined and re-defined.
